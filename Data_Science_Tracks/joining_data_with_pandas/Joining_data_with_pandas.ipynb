    "# Course Description<br>\n",
    "Being able to combine and work with multiple datasets is an essential skill for any aspiring Data Scientist. pandas is a crucial cornerstone of the Python data science ecosystem, with Stack Overflow recording 5 million views for pandas questions. Learn to handle multiple DataFrames by combining, organizing, joining, and reshaping them using pandas. You’ll work with datasets from the World Bank and the City Of Chicago. You will finish the course with a solid skillset for data-joining in pandas. You can visit Joining Data with pandas to run the code in the Jupiter Notebook version of this document on Google Colab. Should there be further discussion, please contact us via email: dattran.hcmiu@gmail.com."

You’ll also learn how the relationship between those sources, such as one-to-one or one-to-many, can affect your result."
